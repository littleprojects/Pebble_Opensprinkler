Tested with PEBBLE SMARTWATCH and OpenSprinkler API 2.1.4 (no SSL)


Just start with https://cloudpebble.net/ 

If you want to test it on the emulator - hardcode the setting:
- settings.pass - md5 hash of your password
- settings.link - youraddress.dyndns.com:8080  (no http://)
- settings.name - your sprinkler name "Home" or so

If you test the app direct on the watch, you can set the settings over the settings-page. :) 
Change the settings-page URL to your adress. I use my dropbox public dir.
